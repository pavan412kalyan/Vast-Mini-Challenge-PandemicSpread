# Vast-Mini-Challenge-PandemicSpread

https://pandemicspreadanalysis.netlify.app/

Our project analyzes the pandemic outbreak across several cities in 2009. As part of the project we want to extract important information like how fast the outbreak is spreading, analyze the common symptoms across all patients, mortality rate and other characteristics of the pandemic spread. We are designing and implementing few visualizations for better understanding of the pandemic outbreak.

Domain abstraction:

MC2 2010 VAST mini challenge is about a major outbreak that occurred in 2009 across the world. Health officials have provided us with information which will help them characterize the spread of the disease in these countries. Analysing this information given to us by the health officials now, will help us understand the seriousness of this or any future pandemic and extract statistics. Here we are given spatio-temporal data, and studying this data after its preprocessing, we visually create data flows that will make the realization of data easy for future study.

Data/Task Abstraction:

Health officials provided us with two excel sheets containing patients data for each location across 11 countries. These files contained several data points representing patient information and attributes with categorical, quantitative and sequential data. One of the excel sheets consists of patients id, age, gender, syndrome and date of admittance while the other one consists of date of death of patients with their idâ€™s.
